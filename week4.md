Test 1 Corrections:
Finals Quiz 1 corrections:

10. A is correct because the customersâ€™ personal information could be compromised if an unauthorized individual gains access to the call session database.

15. C is correct because as an email message passes through the Internet, it goes through intermediate computers and routers. These computers and routers could read the contents of the email. The credit card number could be read from the email.

16. B is correct because  it is not possible to determine the number of movies purchased by an individual subscriber for a particular month. In this database, information about individual subscribers, such as their ID number, is not stored.

20. A is correct because when list1 and list2 are combined, the newList may have duplicates and will likely not be sorted. Performing the Sort and then the RemoveDuplicates procedures will result in a list that is sorted, has no duplicates, and contains the names of all the books found in either list1 or list2.

21. C is correct because the Internet is an interconnected network of networks, and the World Wide Web is an information system that is accessed via the Internet.

23. A is correct because the aggregation of information in browser cookies can be used by websites that the user visits to track the user and collect information about the user.

26. C is correct because this is the only option that shows what the database does not include

29. C is correct because the variable sum is initialized to store the value of the first element of numList, and because the iteration block is a FOR EACH loop, the value of the first element is added to sum twice. Since the first element of the list is 0, adding this number to the sum does not affect the sum. A non-zero first element would give an incorrect result. In general, a single test case is not sufficient to confirm that a program works as intended.

32. C is correct. Line 5 should appear between lines 2 and 3

36. A is correct because the database stores information on item identification numbers and quantities available, the retailer can search for all item identification numbers that have a quantity of 0.

38. C is correct. Statement II is correct because the repository of stored metadata includes time, so information about the time of calls can be analyzed to make predictions about future calls. Statement III is correct because the metadata stores the phone numbers of the two parties of a call. Given one phone number, the metadata can be processed to provide all phone numbers that were called by or placed to that person.

39. C is correct; 80 seconds is the minimum time

43. C is correct: The user is sent an email appearing to be from the manufacturer, asking the user to confirm the account password by clicking on a link in the email and entering the password on the resulting page.

44. A is correct because phishing attacks are characterized by a communication from a person trying to trick another person into divulging personal information. Because the phone number on a bank card is public information and not personal, this request does not indicate a phishing attack.

45. C is correct because the cost of a given product is not tracked by the described search engine.

48. A is correct because removing the connections between C and F and between F and H will prevent devices A and F from communicating.

49. D is correct because the actions of the ISP will only affect how frequently visited pages are loaded into Web browsers. Pages not saved by the ISP are still accessed as they were before
