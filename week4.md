Week 1 reflection: Overall, week 1 went more slowly than I had expected. Although the daily tasks weren't the most challenging, I failed to delegate breaks or account for emergency situations, such as family outings or work. This made me think that I would have to revise my plans for the next two weeks, so I can be more focused and have a better sense of direction.

**Finals Quiz 1 corrections:**

10. A is correct because the customers’ personal information could be compromised if an unauthorized individual gains access to the call session database.

15. C is correct because as an email message passes through the Internet, it goes through intermediate computers and routers. These computers and routers could read the contents of the email. The credit card number could be read from the email.

16. B is correct because  it is not possible to determine the number of movies purchased by an individual subscriber for a particular month. In this database, information about individual subscribers, such as their ID number, is not stored.

20. A is correct because when list1 and list2 are combined, the newList may have duplicates and will likely not be sorted. Performing the Sort and then the RemoveDuplicates procedures will result in a list that is sorted, has no duplicates, and contains the names of all the books found in either list1 or list2.

21. C is correct because the Internet is an interconnected network of networks, and the World Wide Web is an information system that is accessed via the Internet.

23. A is correct because the aggregation of information in browser cookies can be used by websites that the user visits to track the user and collect information about the user.

26. C is correct because this is the only option that shows what the database does not include

29. C is correct because the variable sum is initialized to store the value of the first element of numList, and because the iteration block is a FOR EACH loop, the value of the first element is added to sum twice. Since the first element of the list is 0, adding this number to the sum does not affect the sum. A non-zero first element would give an incorrect result. In general, a single test case is not sufficient to confirm that a program works as intended.

32. C is correct. Line 5 should appear between lines 2 and 3

36. A is correct because the database stores information on item identification numbers and quantities available, the retailer can search for all item identification numbers that have a quantity of 0.

38. C is correct. Statement II is correct because the repository of stored metadata includes time, so information about the time of calls can be analyzed to make predictions about future calls. Statement III is correct because the metadata stores the phone numbers of the two parties of a call. Given one phone number, the metadata can be processed to provide all phone numbers that were called by or placed to that person.

39. C is correct; 80 seconds is the minimum time

43. C is correct: The user is sent an email appearing to be from the manufacturer, asking the user to confirm the account password by clicking on a link in the email and entering the password on the resulting page.

44. A is correct because phishing attacks are characterized by a communication from a person trying to trick another person into divulging personal information. Because the phone number on a bank card is public information and not personal, this request does not indicate a phishing attack.

45. C is correct because the cost of a given product is not tracked by the described search engine.

48. A is correct because removing the connections between C and F and between F and H will prevent devices A and F from communicating.

49. D is correct because the actions of the ISP will only affect how frequently visited pages are loaded into Web browsers. Pages not saved by the ISP are still accessed as they were before

**Final Quiz 2 Corrections:**

2. B is correct because one contributing factor to the digital divide is lack of access to the Internet. Deploying more satellites and network infrastructure would provide a way to allow Internet access in remote areas.

4. B is correct because the digital divide describes the differences in access to computing devices and the Internet. Requiring job applicants to apply online serves only individuals who already have access to computing devices and the Internet. It does not help reduce the divide.

7. B is correct because lossless compression algorithms are guaranteed to be able to reconstruct the original data, while lossy compression algorithms are not.

10. D is correct because options II and III perform the steps in a correct order. In order to generate the desired list, the algorithm must perform the "shorten" step after the "keep palindromes" step, otherwise the "keep palindromes" step would not be able to determine whether the original word was a palindrome.

11. A and D are correct because the time and date that a photo is taken is considered metadata about the image. This information can be used to determine the chronological order of the images.

19. C is correct because when x is negative, y is assigned the value true and the value of y is displayed. When x is not negative, y is assigned the value false and the display statement is never executed.

22. B is correct because IPv6 allows for a greater number of IP addresses than IPv4 does, which allows more devices to be connected.

26. A is correct because the need for software testing is not eliminated, even with effective collaborators. Testing ensures that an algorithm or program is producing the expected outcomes.

32. D is correct because four bits can represent 24, or 16 pieces of information.

35. C is correct because overflow errors occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value outside the range of numbers that can be represented by a fixed number of bits.

37. A is correct because a unique identifier would be required in order to distinguish between two students with the same first and last names.

40. D is correct because citizen science involves members of the general public participating in scientific research. Distributing the image analysis work to a larger group of individuals allows the work to be completed in less time.

45. A is correct because the desired information can be determined by using the student IDs in spreadsheet II to identify the students who play a sport. Once the students who play a sport are identified, the grade point averages of students who play sports in spreadsheet I can be compared to the grade point averages of all other students in spreadsheet I.

47. A is correct because the s, indicating participants who are interested in the application, are clustered toward the top of the graph.
This indicates that participants who read more were generally more likely to say they are interested in the application.

49. C is correct because the transformation is lossless because an encoded string can be restored to its original version. For example,  can be restored to  by replacing all instances of with  and by replacing all instances of  with .

50. D is correct because the average total points earned per student can be determined using the result of the total points calculation
for each student. The average increase in total points per student as a result of the score replacement policy can be determined by
calculating the differences between each student score before and after the replacement policy was applied. The proportion of students
who improved their total points as a result of the score replacement policy can be determined by comparing the midterm and final scores for each student with the result of the total points calculation.

**Quiz 3 Corrections:**

2. B is correct because one contributing factor to the digital divide is lack of access to the Internet. Deploying more satellites and network infrastructure would provide a way to allow Internet access in remote areas.

4. B is correct because the digital divide describes the differences in access to computing devices and the Internet. Requiring job applicants to apply online serves only individuals who already have access to computing devices and the Internet. It does not help reduce the divide.

7. B is correct because lossless compression algorithms are guaranteed to be able to reconstruct the original data, while lossy compression algorithms are not.

10. D is correct because options II and III perform the steps in a correct order. In order to generate the desired list, the algorithm must perform the "shorten" step after the "keep palindromes" step, otherwise the "keep palindromes" step would not be able to determine whether the original word was a palindrome.

11. A and D are correct because the time and date that a photo is taken is considered metadata about the image. This information can be used to determine the chronological order of the images.

**Quiz 5 Results and corrections; only did 25**

![Screen Shot 2022-05-06 at 11 30 15 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219568/167197262-759f20bd-75f0-4945-8994-b1598587f9c3.png)

9. A is correct because this option is incorrect. If the value of y was 2, the inner loop would repeat two times and the outer loop would repeat three times. The statement   would be executed 3 times 2, or six times. When y = 2, the value of y + 3 is 5, not 6.

19. A and C are correct; to remove the first 2 characters of oldString, this code segment takes a substring starting at position 3. To remove the last 2 characters of oldString, the substring ends at the position that is 4 characters less than the length of oldString (since 4 characters are removed).

21. C is correct because the REPEAT UNTIL statement subtracts 2 from the parameter number until the condition number ≤ 0 is true. After this REPEAT loop ends, the value of number is either 0 (if the original number was even) or –1 (if the original number was odd).

22. C is correct because by current standards, a single high school’s list of student grades is not considered a large set of data. Furthermore, identifying 10 students with the highest grade point averages is not an example of finding patterns.

24. A and D are correct; they return the correct value

25. A and D are correct; this code segment assigns 500 bonus points by default. If timer is less than 30, no additional bonus points are added. If timer is between 30 and 60 inclusive, bonus is incremented by 500 in the first IF block. If timer is greater than 60, bonus is incremented by 500 twice (once in each IF block). The correct number of bonus points is assigned to bonus for all possible values of timer.
