1. **Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?** He doesn't think that it is intentional and thought of it as a joke to his friends.

2. **How do you think this happened?** Since the background is dark, it is harder for the computer to detect.

3. **Should it be corrected?** Yes, but as developments in technologies have been made, this problem is continuously being resolved.

4. **What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?** HP could diversify and hire more people of color and test out different adaptations.

6.4

1. **CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?** Especially in consideration of the AP CSP students, one crowdsourcing idea would be the major that the students plan on applying for in Universities. Since AP CSP is a very niche class, it is appealing to a very specific group of people. Therefore, the data crowdsourced could be predicted that a lot of people will be majoring in computer science or some form of data structures in college.

2. **What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?** At Del Norte, classes like Statistics uses crowdsourcing to obtain data they can generalize to a wider population. Crowdsourcing obtains diversified opinions and creates more accurate data that is unbiased. My final project can be better with crowdsourcing, because then we can get better feedback from Del Norte students and create an efficient website that a lot of people find useful.

5.1

While a dopamine rush can be obtained through coding, it's important to have other sources of entertainment that can provide movement Lack of mobility leads to laziness and lack of socialization

Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing; beneficial: skills that can be applicable to the evergrowing internet, meeting people virtually, more opportunities to diversify. Harmful effects: lack of exercise leads to decline in health, lack of socialization prevents necessary skills to be developed, sole focus on computing distracts from other daily tasks necessary for function.
5.2

How does someone empower themselves in a digital world? A person empowers themselves in a digital world by having the resources needed to guarantee success. However, not everyone is able to empower themselves because there could be disparities in wealth and accessibility.

How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. At DNHS, one thing that someone who is empowered can do to help someone who isn't empowered would be to share resources. For example, perhaps two students can code together on the same computer and collaborate in order to write a functioning program that combines the intellect of both individuals. In the real world, one way the empowered can help the not empowered is to suggest alternative methods of achieving the same results

Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? Paper is not blocking digital empowerment. While the world is trending towards a more digital era, it's crucial to consider that addiction to the internet is real, as seen by examples of multiple high school students. With paper, we are assisting digital empowerment by preventing addiction and promoting moderation. Red tape does the same job; it's a preventative measure that prevents addiction.
